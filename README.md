## General Introduction: Solar Tracking

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

One problem which could be solved in a smart city is optimizing solar panels. Solar panels are most efficient when using a solar tracker, which orients the panels towards the sun. This problem can be solved using a simple simulation in Python. 

By maximizing the efficiency of solar panels, solar energy can make up a greater portion of the energy requirements of the city of Orlando, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. This program will simulate a tip-tilt dual axis solar tracker, allowing maximization based on time of day and time of year. By including functionality to retract the panels during periods of high wind, we can also reduce the likelihood of damage. In addition, by signalling the user when a battery is full, we can improve the implementation of home solar for lay users.

These types of dual axis solar trackers are used in smaller installations, where the same increase in output is not possible through adding additional solar panels. However, they are not suitable for rooftop installations due to the increased mechanical requirements and additional wind speeds. This simulation will be useful for deciding if a dual axis solar tracker is an appropriate choice for a given location. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_tracker)

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)

## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

* [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) - provides the high level overview of components
* [**Class Diagram**](model/class_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Behavior Diagram**](model/behavior_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Agent / User case** (if appropriate)](model/agent_usecase_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)
